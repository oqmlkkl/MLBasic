# MLBasic
This is a repository which marks down my step on self-teaching machine learning techniques, algorithms are implemented based on my interests and readings. I will try to update this repo in a frequency of 1 to 2 updates per 2 days. Welcome if you have any suggestions on my code.
## Gradient Descent:
   - Most basic type of linear regression, using gradient descent to learn.
## Logistic Regression:
   - A simple binary classification algorithm..
   - correctness: over 95%
## SimpleNN:
   - A simple neural network using cross-entropy cost function to do classification on mnist dataset
   - correctness: Around 96% under given parameters
## KMeans:
   - Simply implemented the KMeans algorithm to do a unsupervised learning
   - correctness: ![Image](./KMeans/k=3.png). I would say this is Okay, but not perfect, I will keep trying to figure out why it's not optimized.
## Naive Bayes:
   - Trying to implement a naive bayes classifier to classify enron mails examples.
   - [x] raw mail -> csv
   - [ ] data analyzed
   - [ ] main body implemented
   - correctness: haven't implemented
